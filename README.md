# Saco Cheio TV APP

## ðŸ’¡ About the project

This is an app version of the [Saco Cheio TV](https://www.sacocheio.tv) platform.

Since the platform doesn't have an official app, and only provides the **RSS Feed** to listen to podcasts on mobile apps, I decided to make this app that aims to listen to podcasts but with the face of Saco Cheio TV.

All the design of this application was done by me using figma (it was a lot of work since I'm not a designer).

If you want to see the layout made by me, it is available at this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/7LuyM5VZsCj6kYRgQiNyaD/sacocheio-tv-app?node-id=0%3A1)

*I created this APP as an excuse to learn new things and step out of my comfort zone. ðŸ¤«*
